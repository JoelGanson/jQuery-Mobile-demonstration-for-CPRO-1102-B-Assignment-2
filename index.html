          <h2>Do cats know their names?</h2>
          <p>
            According to PetMD<a href="#citations">¹</a> cats dow know their own
            names as long as you use positive reinforcement. They can also learn
            the names of your other pets and can tell when they are being talked
            to or if someone or something else is being talked to.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way to teach your cat its name is to associate it with good
            things. Try saying its name before giving it treats, playing with
            it, or petting it. Try to avoid saying its name when doing things it
            may not like, such as putting it in its carrier or giving them a
            bath.

          <h2>Essential tips to raise healthy cats</h2>
          <p>
            An article by the Valley West & Elk Valley Veterinary Hospital<a
              href="#citations"
              >²</a
            >
            gives the impression that there are seven vital steps to raising a
            health and happy cat. Paying attention to their diet, particularly
            giving them good wet food, is the vital first step. Your cat always
            needs water available as well, but they get most of their water from
            their food. It's important to introduce wet food early, because they
            can get too used to dry food and turn their nose up at the healthier
            food.
          </p>
          <p>
            A second vital step is to make sure your cat has a safe place to go
            if they ever feel threatend or stressed, and that their litter box
            is in such a place. This includes giving each cat you care for its
            own seperate litter box, and avoiding lidded litter boxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third thing VWEVVH lists is not having too many cats. Cats are
            territorial, and while they can be social, they typically want lots
            of space for themselves. The article says that two is a good
            maximum, but I disagree and say three is a good number.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is recomended to enrich your cats' environment fourth, in order
            to cut down on vet visits. At the same time, they list seeing the
            vet regularly as their fifth item. This means providing lots of toys
            and climbing spaces, and scratching posts; that way, your cat gets
            the exercise they need without being destructive. And when you do go
            to the vet, it should be to get the vaccinations they need, and
            hopefully not for injuries they have sustained by being let outdoors
            because the indoors isn't enriching enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            Article item six is brushing. While your cat may lick themselves
            clean, this can cause them to swallow their loose fur and cause
            gross hairballs. These are not only a pain to clean up after your
            cat has hacked them up, but they can hurt the cat while it's trying
            to dislodge it! Brushing the cat regularly to remove excess fur can
            prevent this, and if the cat isn't cooperative you can assosiate
            brushing with positive things like giving them treats.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last on their list is to spay or neuter your cat. They say that a
            cat in heat is very uncomfortable, so spaying or neutering the cat
            can help prevent that discomfort. It also keeps cats from becoming
            overpopulated, because too many cats have to be put down since
            there's not enough people to care for them.

        <div class="ui-body ui-body-a ui-corner-all" id="attack">
          <h2>Why does my cat attack me?</h2>
          <p>
            I'm going to answer this one from personal experience. The
            personality of a cat is as varied as the personality of a person.
            Some people are just spiteful jerks while others enjoy playful
            banter, and some cats are just hunters by nature. The primary
            motiviation for a cat to pounce on you is their hunting instinct,
            which for some cats is more pronounced than others.
          </p>
          <p>
            While hunting and pouncing can be seen as a form of play,
            occasionally you may suffer cat attacks of other varieties.
            Aggressive clawings when your cat is in a small space, possibly
            trying to get away from you, are an indication that you are
            bothering the cat and not giving them enough space. It can be a sign
            that there is no safe place for them to go, or that you have been
            hurting your cat somehow.
          </p>
          <p>
            A cat that bites hard is unhappy in similar but different ways. It
            does not want to be touched, moved, or sought after. It probably
            feels smothered. Try giving a biting cat more independance, and more
            hiding spaces. In a cluttered house, this can also be a sign that
            the cat is stressed. However, playful bites, whether they break skin
            or not, are not meant to hurt you, and they indicate that your cat
            is simply bored. Try getting some more toys, and interacting with
            your cat more. I suggest letting them sniff whatever you are
            handling, such as food or phones, when they come to investigate.

        <div class="ui-body ui-body-a ui-corner-all" id="party">
          <h2>How to throw a birthday party for your cat</h2>
          <p>
            Cats don't really understand the concept of a birthday. They may be
            vaguely aware of seasons passing, but they don't mark the days on a
            calendar the same way humans do. But if you want to throw a party
            for your cat, the best way is to not disturb the cat's routine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start by inviting only people who the cat is familiar with. You can
            invite other pets as well, if you know the cat deals well with those
            pets and socialization. But do not invite too many people and pets.
            Your cat is still territorial, and too many beings infringing on
            your cat's home can really stress them out. A small party is a good
            party.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not over decorate. Your cat won't understand that the party is
            for them, and too many decorations can make their environment
            cluttered and unfamiliar, which also stresses them out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Get them a healthy but tasty treat. Don't feed your cat regular cake
            that a human would eat. You can have a regular cake to share with
            your human guests, but cats are carnivourous. A large dish of salmon
            or other meats is a good treat for a cat to eat on their birthday.
          </p>
